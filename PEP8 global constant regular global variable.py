'''Create a Python script that defines both a global constant and a regular global variable following PEP 8 conventions. Your script should:

Define a constant for the speed of light(`SPEED_OF_LIGHT=299792458`).
Define a regular global variable called `current_temperature` and assign it a value.
Print both values.'''

# Global Constants
SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 299792458

# Regular Global Variables
current_temperature = 85

# Print the values
print("Speed of light:", SPEED_OF_LIGHT, "m/s")
print("Current Temperature:", current_temperature, "Â°F")
