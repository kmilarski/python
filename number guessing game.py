'''Write a short interactive Python program of your choice that uses try and except to catch and respond to at least two specific exceptions. Your program should:

    -Include a main() function.

    -Use try and except to catch specific errors like ValueError or ZeroDivisionError.

    -Provide helpful messages when errors occur.

    -Do something meaningful or funâ€”be creative! You could build a number guessing game, a basic calculator, or even a simple quiz with input validation.
